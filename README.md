# Binary Space Partition

* BSP tree is a heirarchical subdivisions of n dimensional space into convex subspaces. The space is subdivided using hyperplanes passing through node. 
* Kd-trees and quad-trees have hyperplanes aligned with the coordinate axis while BSP tree has hyperplanes with any orientation.
